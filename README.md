### Welcome to my GitHub pageðŸ‘‹

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Analytics and Operations at Imperial College Business School, with an affiliation with the Imperial-X initiative.

My research involves making methodological advances in mixed-integer and nonlinear optimization, and applying these advances to solve central problems in the operations research, machine learning and statistics literatures. I am particularly interested in developing new algorithms for problems that are currently considered out of reach, such as solving low-rank matrix or tensor problems to certifiable optimality.
