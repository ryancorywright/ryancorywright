### Welcome to my GitHub pageðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD candidate at [MITâ€™s](mit.edu) [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu/), advised by [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://dbertsim.mit.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization, machine learning and statistics.

My research involves making methodological advances in mixed-integer and nonlinear optimization, and applying these advances to solve central problems in the operations research, machine learning and statistics literatures. I am particularly interested in developing new algorithms for problems that are currently considered out of reach, such as solving low-rank matrix or tensor problems to certifiable optimality.
